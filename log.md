# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 31, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Followed a scrimba tutorial to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game in React using hooks and fuctional components. Today is day 0, it does not count.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed getting back into development work. I know I didn't challenge myself a lot mentally today since it was more of a 'type-after-me' exercise, but it was enjoyable to hop back on the horse after letting life get me sidetracked.
